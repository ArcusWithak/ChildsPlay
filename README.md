## Context

This final assignment, together with the code organization challenge will be the primary points of grading for this block.
The assignment needs to be delivered as a pull request to this repository (Exactly the same thing you did with the code organization challenge). 

You are supposed to create a simple game, based on the mechanics of child's playground games. The game does not need to be about children or for children, the mechanics are set but the context is not. For example: Hide and Seek could be a ghost / horror game or a zombie shooter, duck, duck, goose could be a mobile puzzle game. etc... Use your imagination and don't be afraid of straying away from the idea, just take the requirements literally, if it checks all, or at least most of the points you'll be fine.

The focus of this  is on the mechanics and AI. Graphics and variety of interactions are of less importance. Try to make it interesting but focus on the requirements first.

## Submitting your work

This project will be developped in teams of two, collaboration and version control will be done through GitHub.

You need to choose one of the mechanics below (it's possible to combine two if you are feeling brave), fork this repository and develop the game. When you are done, submit a pull request. 

DO NOT FORGET: Comment your commits properly, you will be graded individualy, based on your commits. If all the commits are from one of the team members, the other will fail this module. So **commit often and clear**.
